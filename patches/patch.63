Subject: Suggested minor change to xntpdc/ntpdc_ops.c

Dave,

     I got tired of looking up the hosts' names in the "reslist" so I
made a minor change.  I tried to make the change portable but I haven't
got a lot of experience with that.  I'm not sure if this code would work
on a Cray (or any non-64 bit word) hardware.
